When there is a will there is a way
Every cloud has a silver lining
The pen is mightier than the sword
A blessing in disguise 
A dime a dozen 
Beat around the bush 
Break a leg 
Better late than never 
Give someone the benefit of the doubt 
Let someone of the hook
Time flies when you're having fun
No pain,no gain
We will cross that bridge when we come to it
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A picture is worth thousand words
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite off more than you can chew
The early bird gets the worm
Don't judge a book by its cover
Calm before the storm
Leave no stone unturned
On cloud nine
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
You can lead a horse to water,but you can't make him drink
A stitch in time saves nine
Cry over spilled milk
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
Actions speak louder than words
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Barking dogs seldom bite
